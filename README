= NoSMSd =

NoSMSd is a python wrapper around the Gammu-smsd Database.
It allows one to easily setup Gammu-smsd and interact with it from python.

It's moto is to let Gammu do all the work. It's a wrapper, not a framework.

Dependences:
    * peewee (pip install peewee)
    * Any database connector you might need.
    Beware that it's been tested only on MySQL.

* Django Integration

NoSMSd does _NOT_ require django.

Still, if you are using it server-side and you are already using django,
you can benefit from the following features:
    - a management command for processing incoming SMS
        ./manage.py nosmsd_incoming 3
        This will allow you to access you django models & other from your
        SMS handler.
    - Django Admin integration: you can view your received and sent messages
        right from the django admin.
    - Add a database named 'smsd' for your NoSMSd schema in your settings.py

* Warnings
    - Gammu is not expecting third parties to mess-around with its DB.
        You should not attempt to write to Django Model.
        It is disabled on purpose. If Gammu encounters a MySQL error (like a
        pk error on the sentitems table with have two pk), it will freeze.


Example Use:

    * Setting-up Gammu
    Please note that NoSMSd Gammu assumes you have a working Gammu-smsd setup.
    NoSMSd itself does only rely on its Database so you can do anything
    without Gammu but you'll eventually need it.
    You can find an example gammu-smsdrc in the contrib/ folder.

    * Settings
    settings.py file holds your settings. The only required one is
    NOSMSD_HANDLER
    It must contain a string describing the python module path of your
    handler function.

    * I want to send a message to number +33198765432
        $ ./nosmsd_sendout.py '+33198765432' "Hello world"

    * I want to test my handler / simulate an incoming SMS
        $ ./nosmsd_inject.py '+3345678654' "weather in bamako?"

    * How do I tell
